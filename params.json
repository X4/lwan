{"name":"Lwan","body":"### Toy web server \r\n\r\nLwan is a toy web server that has been written as means to study event-oriented socket programming under Linux. While it delivers good performance (~390000 requests/s for static content on a Core i7 laptop), it is not meant to be used on a production environment -- it is simply not resilient enough.\r\n\r\nHowever, while being used in real life isn't a supported -- desired even -- scenario, that does not mean it is something utopic. That's why it has been released as Free Software: so it can be improved.","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
